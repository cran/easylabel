# Introduction

A common problem in R is labelling scatter plots with large numbers of points
and/or labels. We provide a utility for easy labelling of scatter plots and 
quick plotting of volcano plots and MA plots for gene expression analyses. Using
an interactive shiny and plotly interface, users can hover over points to see
where specific points are located and click on points to easily label them. 
Labels can be toggled on/off simply by clicking. An input box and batch input 
window provides an easy way to label points by name. Labels can be dragged 
around the plot to place them optimally. Notably we provide an easy way to 
export directly to pdf for publication.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

# Installation

Install from CRAN
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("easylabel")
library(easylabel)
```

Install from Github
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("myles-lewis/easylabel")
library(easylabel)
```

We recommend installing at least version 4.9.4.9 (currently the development 
version) of plotly which has much better on-screen resolution of scatter plots 
for a better user experience. Note that exporting to pdf is unaffected by this.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```

If you wish to use the optional `useQ` argument with `easyVolcano()` and 
`easyMAplot()`, you will need to install additional package `qvalue` from 
Bioconductor:
```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("qvalue")
```

If you wish to use the optional `fullGeneNames` argument, you will need to 
install packages `AnnotationDbi` and `org.Hs.eg.db` from Bioconductor:
```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("AnnotationDbi")
BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

# Scatter plots

Use `easylabel()` to open a shiny app and plot and label scatter plots. A table of 
the main data is supplied in the Table tab for easy viewing of data.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data(mtcars)
easylabel(mtcars, x = 'mpg', y = 'wt',
          colScheme = 'royalblue')
```

```{r scatter1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("scatter1.png")
```

## Export plot to PDF
* Hover over and click on/off genes which you want to label.
* When you have selected all your chosen genes, then drag gene names to move
  label positions.
* Click the save button to export a PDF in base graphics.

## Export SVG from plotly
* You can move the legend as well.
* Switch to SVG when finalised (only do this at last moment as otherwise
  editing can very slow, particularly with large numbers of points).
* Press the camera button in the plotly modebar to save image as SVG.

## Colour

Similar to ggplot2 and plotly, colour can either be set as a single colour, 
using `colScheme = 'blue'` or can be set to change with the level of a factor 
variable within `data` by setting `col`. Transparency can be altered by setting
`alpha`. Currently colour gradients are not supported.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easylabel(mtcars, x = 'mpg', y = 'wt',
          col = 'cyl')
```

## Shape

Marker shapes can either be set as a single shape using `shapeScheme = 21`, 
based on the base graphics `pch` symbol scheme (see `points()`), or shapes can 
be set to change with the level of a factor variable within `data` by setting 
`shape`. Shapes and colours can be combined.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# gapminder data set
if(!require(gapminder)) {install.packages("gapminder")}
library(gapminder)
easylabel(gapminder[gapminder$year == 2007, ], x = 'gdpPercap', y = 'lifeExp',
          col = 'continent', shape = 'continent',
          size = 10,
          labs = 'country', 
          zeroline = FALSE)
```

```{r scatter3, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("scatter3.png")
```

## Size

The size of all markers can be adjusted by setting `size` to a single number 
e.g. `size = 6` (default 8). Size can be assigned to a column of continuous data 
within `data` to produce a bubble chart. The size of points is automatically 
scaled to fit within a range of point sizes, determined by `scaleRange`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
easylabel(gapminder[gapminder$year == 2007, ], x = 'gdpPercap', y = 'lifeExp',
          col = 'continent', labs = 'country', 
          size = 'pop',
          alpha = 0.6,
          zeroline = FALSE)
```

```{r bubble, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("bubble.png")
```

## Choosing label names

By default, `easylabel()` takes the rownames of the main dataframe as the label 
names. Any column can be selected for label names by setting `labs` to the name 
of a column within `data`, as for example in the Gapminder dataset plots above.

## Axis titles

Axis titles can be set using `xlab` and `ylab`. These accept R expressions to 
allow maths symbols. This is primarily designed to work when exporting plots to 
pdf via base graphics, since plotly does not natively understand expressions.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easylabel(ymatrix, x = 'x', y = 'y', col = 'col',
          colScheme = c('darkgrey', 'green3', 'gold3', 'blue'),
          xlab = expression("log"[2] ~ " fold change post-Rituximab"),
          ylab = expression("log"[2] ~ " fold change post-Tocilizumab"),
          showgrid = TRUE)
```

```{r plot1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot1.png")
```

## Gridlines

Gridlines can be shown by setting `showgrid = TRUE`. Black lines through the 
origin can be controlled by setting `zeroline` to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Dashed grey 
horizontal lines can be added at specific levels by setting `hline` with a 
vector of values. Similarly dashed grey vertical lines can be added by setting 
`vline` with a vector of values.

# Volcano plots

Use the `easyVolcano()` function to quickly plot a volcano plot from DESeq2 or
EdgeR objects. The `useQ` argument will switch to using q values for FDR.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# typical DESeq2 workflow
volc1 <- results(dds)
easyVolcano(volc1, useQ = TRUE)
```

## MA plots

Use the `easyMAplot()` function to quickly plot an MA plot from DESeq2 or EdgeR
objects.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyMAplot(volc2, useQ = TRUE)
```

```{r easyMAplot1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("MAplot1.png")
```

## Expanding full gene names

The `fullGeneNames` argument will use Bioconductor package `AnnotationDbi` and
the `org.Hs.eg.db` human gene database to expand gene symbols in the Table tab.
Both will need to be installed from Bioconductor.

```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("AnnotationDbi")
BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")
easyVolcano(volc1, useQ = TRUE, fullGeneNames = TRUE)
```

```{r table1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("table1.png")
```

Full gene names are also shown when hovering over points in the scatter plot,
which can make it easier to label points of interest. For mouse genes, install 
`org.Mm.eg.db` and set `AnnotationDb = org.Mm.eg.db` (note the lack of quotes).

```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("org.Mm.eg.db")
library(org.Mm.eg.db)
easyVolcano(volc1,
          fullGeneNames = TRUE,
          AnnotationDb = org.Mm.eg.db)
```

## Colour schemes

For volcano plots a simple colour scheme with downregulated genes in blue and
upregulated genes in red can be rendered by setting `fccut = 0`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyVolcano(volc2,
            useQ = TRUE,
            fccut = 0,
            main = "Volcano title")
```

```{r plot7, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot7.png")
```

## Titles

A title can be added using `main = "Title"`. The font size of the title can be 
modified using `cex.main = 2` (default 1.2) if saving to pdf.

## Adding left/right subtitles

You can add left and right sided titles using `Ltitle` and `Rtitle` to explain
the direction of effect for up/downregulation. The use of `expression` in the
example below shows how to add left/right arrow symbols to the titles. The 
symbols only appear in the saved pdf - they are not compatible with plotly.

`LRtitle_side = 1` puts these titles on the bottom while `LRtitle_side = 3` puts
them on the top.

`cex.lab` controls font size for these titles as well as axis titles.
`cex.axis` controls font size for axis numbering.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyVolcano(volc1,
            useQ = TRUE, fullGeneNames = TRUE,
            Ltitle = expression(symbol("\254") ~ "Non-responder"),
            Rtitle = expression("Responder" ~ symbol("\256")),
            LRtitle_side = 1,
            cex.lab = 0.9, cex.axis = 0.8,
            fccut = c(1, 2), fdrcutoff = 0.2,
            ylim = c(0, 6), xlim = c(-5, 5),
            colScheme = c('darkgrey', 'blue', 'orange', 'red'))
```

```{r plot3, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot3.png")
```

## Setting P value cut-off

The FDR cutoff is set using `fdrcutoff` (volcano plots allow a single value,
while MA plots allow multiple values). In order to force significant
genes to be shown based on unadjusted P values, this can be achieved by a
workaround setting both `y` and `padj` manually to the unadjusted p value
column. Note this does mean the legend incorrectly states 'FDR < ' etc.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyVolcano(volc1, y = 'pvalue', padj = 'pvalue', fdrcutoff = 0.01)
```

## Axis limits and outliers

`xlim` and `ylim` allow control over the range of each axis. Outlying points are
shown as diamonds (see example above). Outliers can be toggled off using 
`showOutliers = FALSE`. Outlier symbol, colour and line width can be set using 
`outlier_shape`, `outlier_col` and `outlier_lwd` respectively.

Axes can be further customised by using `panel.last`, see [panel.last].

## Complex colour schemes

The colour scheme system has been expanded to allow multiple fold change
cut-offs. In the example above the colours are symmetrical. 

In the next 2 plots, the colours range from blue for downregulated genes,
through to red for upregulated genes. Vertical lines can be added using `vline`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
colScheme <- c('darkgrey', 'blue', 'lightblue', 'orange', 'red')
easyVolcano(volc1, fccut = 1, fdrcutoff = 0.2,
            ylim = c(0, 6), xlim = c(-5, 5),
            colScheme = colScheme, 
            vline = c(-1, 1))
```

```{r plot4, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot4.png")
```

The next example has 6 colours and also shows how to remove the white outlines
around points using `outline_col = NA` and use transparency instead via `alpha`.
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
colScheme <- c('darkgrey', brewer.pal(9, 'RdYlBu')[c(9:7, 3:1)])
easyVolcano(volc1, fccut = c(1, 2), fdrcutoff = 0.2, 
            ylim = c(0, 6), xlim = c(-5, 5),
            colScheme = colScheme, 
            alpha = 0.75, outline_col = NA)
```

```{r plot5, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot5.png")
```

Similarly 6 colours can be applied to MA plots using 3 levels of cut-off for FDR
(note the colour scheme is in a slightly different order).

```{r eval = FALSE}
colScheme <- c('darkgrey', brewer.pal(9, 'RdYlBu')[c(7:9, 3:1)])
easyMAplot(volc2, fdrcutoff = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001), size = 6, useQ = TRUE,
       alpha = 0.75, outline_col = NA,
       colScheme = colScheme)
```

```{r easyMAplot2, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("MAplot2.png")
```

# Further control of plotting

Further control of plotting can be achieved by passing other arguments to 
plot() via R's `...` argument. For example, a box around the plot can be added 
using `bty='o'` (see `par()`). Note this method only works for saving to pdf 
since it is not supported by plotly. 

## panel.last

Base graphics' `panel.last` argument is a flexible way to add plotting commands.
This provides a way to add trend lines, loess lines or any additional features 
such as extra legends to the plot after the points are plotted, but before 
labels are drawn.

The code below uses `panel.last` to completely customise the numbering of the 
axis ticks. Note that `panel.last` only works when saving to pdf, and is not 
available in plotly.

Axes can be customised by first suppressing the initial axis using `xaxt='n'` or
`yaxt='n'` and then adding an `axis()` call using `panel.last`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyVolcano(volc1, useQ = TRUE, fdrcutoff = 0.2, ylim = c(0,8), xlim = c(-6,6),
            size = 4.8,
            xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n', bty = 'o',
            main = "DEG volcano plot",
            panel.last = {
              axis(side = 1, at = -6:6)
              axis(side = 2, at = 0:8)
            })
```

# Controlling labels

Label lines can be altered using the argument `labelDir` or by selecting the
Label direction pulldown menu in the shiny app. Options are shown below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
easyVolcano(volc1, labelDir = "horiz")
easyMAplot(volc1, labelDir = "vert")
```

```{r labdirs1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='48%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("labdir_horiz.png", "labdir_vert.png"))
```

## Adding label boxes

Rectangles can be drawn around the label text, using `rectangles = TRUE`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Simple outlines
easyVolcano(volc2, useQ = TRUE, fccut = 0,
            rectangles = TRUE)

# Red outlined labels, rounded ends
easyVolcano(volc2, useQ = TRUE, fullGeneNames = TRUE,
            rectangles = TRUE,
            padding = 5,
            border_radius = 10,
            line_col = 'red',
            border_col = 'red',
            text_col = 'red')
```

```{r labrect2, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("rect_red_outline.png")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Transparent grey rectangles, rounded ends
easyMAplot(volc2, fdrcut = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001), size = 6, useQ = TRUE,
       alpha = 0.75, outline_col = NA,
       fullGeneNames = TRUE,
       colScheme = c('darkgrey', brewer.pal(9, 'RdYlBu')[c(7:9, 3:1)]),
       rectangles = TRUE,
       border_col = NA,
       padding = 5,
       rect_col = adjustcolor('grey', alpha.f = 0.6),
       border_radius = 20)

# White text on black background, no rounding
easyVolcano(volc2, useQ = TRUE, fullGeneNames = TRUE,
            fccut = 0,
            rectangles = TRUE,
            padding = 4,
            border_radius = 0,
            rect_col = 'black',
            text_col = 'white',
            border_col = NA)
```

```{r labrect4, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='80%', out.extra='style="border: 0;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("rect_invert.png")
```


# Known issues

* Plotly's `scattergl` function, which uses webGL, seems to have a limit of 
  around 400,000 scatter points per plot. Above this level, at around 500,000 
  points the shiny/plotly app becomes sluggish and at >600,000 points it tends 
  to freeze and becomes unusable.
* Currently `easylabel()` relies on plotly for the interactive scatter plot
  and uses webGL for speed as a plotly scattergl trace. A known bug exists in 
  the current version 4.9.4.1 of plotly for R which is still using plotly.js 
  version 2.0. This older version of plotly.js has a problem with poor 
  pixellation of scatter plots, particularly on highDPI (retina) displays. This 
  issue has been fixed in plotly.js version 2.5 and plotly/r version 4.9.4.9,
  which can be installed via Github:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```
