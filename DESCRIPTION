Description: Interactive labelling of scatter plots and volcano plots using a 
    'shiny' and 'plotly' interface. Users can hover over points to see where 
    specific points are located and click points on/off to easily label them. 
    Labels can be dragged around the plot to place them optimally. Plots can be 
    exported directly to pdf for publication.
